Recently, I got an opportunity to work on this PHP framework called [Laravel 4](http://laravel.com). This post is about my experiences with the framework.

In the beginning, I wasn't too impressed. I had some level of experience with [Yii framework](http://www.yiiframework.com) and I was under the impression that this one wasn't going to be any different either. At this juncture, it's significant to say that this was the phase when I badly wanted to have hands on in Ruby on Rails and was following a few Reddit threads on why PHP was a failure and how RoR and Full stack JS were the future. 

Then, after a week or so, I slowely started realising the leap I'd taken from Yii to Laravel and it turns out that it's huge! I could go on and on about comparing Yii and Laravel, but that's not what I intend to write here.

##### Few awesome things in Laravel

* The entire workflow for the App routes, filters(to restrict users) and authentication/autnorisation was so neat. Everything was so structured and intuitive. All you have to do is to open *routes.php* and establish your routes, *filters.php* to write validations and checks to monitor user permission for specific routes. About, authentication, Laravel provides a default Auth provider library which is prettry extensive. 

* Package and dependency management was never easiser. With the emergence of *[Composer](http://getcomposer.com)* and [Packagist](packagiinst.org), a lot of useful implementations are available for Laravel and they can be ready included and published in the app.

* Laravel has made writing RESTful APIs a cake walk. No kidding. All you have to do is to identify your Resources and their end-points. Laravel provides classes that are called as *Resources* which have a default declaration and prototype definition for the HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. I just loved this.

* Since Laravel 4 is relatively new, the community is really active. The public forum and IRC have helped me a lot. 

##### Give it a try!

Next time you're starting a project in PHP, consider working in Laravel. It has really redefined development in PHP. At least, I was able to notice it after coming from the Yii world. I'll share few resources that you might find helpful.

* [Laravel tips and tricks](http://laravel-tricks.com)
* [Laravel snippets](http://laravelsnippets.com)
* Laravel- From Apprentice to Artisan by Taylor Otwell, the creator of Laravel.
* [Laravel forum](http://laravel.io)

This is just the tip of the iceberg, literally. Concepts like InversionOfControl and Facades are topics for a separate blog post altogether!  

May the Force be with you!
