Hi, there!
Thanks for visiting my personal website. I'm glad that you decided to get to know me better.
##### A quick summary...
I'm a 22 year old who loves building stuff, mostly web based and derive satisfaction from seeing people use it. At least, that's what I want to do. I appreciate good design and deify people who have a knack for creating good design. I have a passion for working with new technologies and I'm an out-and-out *[minimalist](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/minimalist)*. I owe it to **[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)** for enlightening me with so many new and useful things. 

*[Sourav Ganguly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sourav_Ganguly)* & *[Steve Jobs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs)* are my biggest inflencers. These two videos are my all time favorites of them.

##### What you can find here...

I intend to write about whatever that piques my curiosity. I believe that writing/documenting whatever I come across helps me be more organised and gives me an opportunity to share wisdom. ;)

That said, you can find posts ranging from *Star Wars* to *Deadmau5* and *Laravel* to random snippets of code. Sounds interesting?
