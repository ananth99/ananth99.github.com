#### Hey there! 
Thanks for visiting my personal website. I'm glad that you decided to get to know me better.

#### A quick summary...
I'm basically a 21 year old who loves developing stuff, mostly web based and derieve satisfaction from seeing people use it. At least, that's what I want to do. I appreciate good design and deify people who have a knack for creating good design. I have a passion for working with new technologies.

I follow this quote by **[Yoda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda)**.

> "Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try."

Cricket runs in my blood and **[Sourav Ganguly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sourav_Ganguly)** has been my biggest inspiration ever since I started following the sport.
