Hi, there!
Thanks for visiting my personal website. I'm glad that you decided to get to know me better.
##### A quick summary...
I'm a 22 year old who loves building stuff, mostly web based and derive satisfaction from seeing people use it. At least, that's what I want to do. I appreciate good design and deify people who have a knack for creating good design. I have a passion for working with new technologies. I owe it to **[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)** for enlightening me with so many new and useful things. 

I follow this quote by **[Yoda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda)**.
> "Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try."

Cricket runs in my blood and **[Sourav Ganguly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sourav_Ganguly)** has been my biggest inspiration ever since I started following the sport. You would find me either in a local play ground or playing Terrace Cricket with a bunch of awesome people during weekends.

I'd love to get to know you!
